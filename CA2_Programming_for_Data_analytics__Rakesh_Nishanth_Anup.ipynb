        " \n",
        "\n",
        "During brainstorming sessions with teammates, we came up with a road map on how we can answer interesting questions. Keeping that in mind, we have specifically identified the Product Name, Price, Description, No. of Ratings, and Reviews as the key variables of interest. These variables will undergo data pre-processing to ensure that they are formatted correctly and are free of any errors or inconsistencies. By cleaning and standardizing the data, we can generate accurate and reliable insights that can be used to inform our research conclusions.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. While working in the pre-processing stage, I firstly imported necessary libraries and loaded the dataset that was obtained after webscraping.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Next, I tried to check the number of observations present in the dataset by using describe(). This gave me the description of reviews like count, mean, maximum, minimum values, standard deviation.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. I checked if there any null values and dropped the null values\n",
        "\n",
        "4. In the middle of this, I wanted to know how many unique values were present in the Reviews column and tried printing them so that this would help in answering a question.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Further I created bins to accommodate the reviews with unique values to sit in particular labels (Low, Medium, High) and created a new column called Label_Reviews.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Since the new column was successfully loaded, I dropped the Reviews column to avoid confusion by keeping only Label_Reviews column and printed the dataframe.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. In this step I again repeated step 4 but now with newly created Label_Reviews column and Prices column to find unique values. In this output it was difficult to accommodate all the Prices in our analysis hence I created another dataframe as Label_prices and defined the categories, so that certain range of products based on price falls under particular category (Like budget phones, smart phones, premium phones).\n",
        "\n",
        "8. After consulting with my teammates, this dataset was finalised to load into to Mongodb. Hence, I again cleaned the dataset and made it ready for the data analysis part and also converted this preprocessed data into CSV file.\n",
        "\n",
        "I had previously worked on data processing on multiple occasions but had never tried webscraping or accessing a Mongodb. So I was eager in engaging with other steps with my friends to try and understand the process involved. Also while coming up with thoughtful questions, I had proposed an idea but it required a data modelling. Overall, it was a wonderful learning curve in this course as this assignment required critical thinking and analysis on the real time data.\n",

        "In this assignment, our primary objective was to overcome multiple challenges and implement a robust data analysis pipeline involving web scraping, data preprocessing, and analysis. Our approach involved formulating critical questions that were significant for both us and our customers purchasing the products. The primary focus was on key parameters affecting the product's quality and customer satisfaction. my primary interest was to design a data analysis pipeline that could deliver meaningful insights and help us make data-driven decisions. As a result, we adopted a professional approach to address the challenges and achieve our objective of delivering valuable insights to our customers.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Initially, we faced several challenges in determining the appropriate website for data scraping. After careful consideration, we decided to use amazon.co.uk for our data collection needs. However, we encountered a significant obstacle during the scraping process, as we discovered that the website's base URL would change periodically for approximately 20-30 minutes. To resolve this issue, Vemula Rakesh, who had previous experience and expertise in web scraping, took on the responsibility of finding a solution. He explored alternative websites and eventually identified flipkart.com as a viable option. Subsequently, we collaborated with Vemula Rakesh to gain a better understanding of web scraping techniques. As a result, we acquired valuable insights into the workings of web scraping and its various nuances.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. After selecting the appropriate website for web scraping, we proceeded with data collection and converted the data into CSV format for further processing. Given my extensive experience in the domain, I took on the responsibility of developing the data analysis pipeline for this assignment, as I believed it to be a critical component of the project. Meanwhile, Nishanth Harish undertook the task of preprocessing the raw data and provided me with a clean and structured dataset that met my specific requirements. Specifically, I requested him to build bins for certain attributes that I deemed crucial for creating an effective data analysis pipeline. Nishanth Harish utilized his own techniques and expertise to deliver a meaningful dataset that aligned with my project objectives.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. After receiving the finalized pre-processed data, we uploaded it to the MongoDB server with the name \"flipkart\" as per our project requirements. My primary responsibility was to design insightful questions based on my domain expertise and knowledge that could potentially aid customers in their product purchasing decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Following the completion of the project, I was able to develop approximately 9-10 meaningful questions based on my subject expertise. However, with further reflection, I recognized that my initial focus was not on queries that could potentially aid customers in their purchasing decisions. Instead, I was drawn to the insights and patterns that could be gleaned from studying customer purchase behavior. This insight sparked my interest and inspired me to study the amount of knowledge contained in the data analysis pipeline in further detail.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Following the formulation of pertinent questions, I embarked on developing a data analysis pipeline that leveraged various techniques such as logical operators in Python. Additionally, I utilized the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), a machine learning algorithm, to extract the most common features present in the product descriptions. Through the implementation of these tools and techniques, I was able to generate valuable insights and make informed decisions based on the analyzed data. The collaborative effort of our team was crucial in ensuring the success of the project.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the project presented numerous challenges that required our team to work collaboratively and draw upon our collective expertise in order to overcome them. Some of the challenges we faced included identifying an appropriate website for web scraping, navigating the intricacies of data preprocessing, and designing insightful questions that could potentially benefit customers in their purchasing decisions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Throughout the project, I learned the importance of effective communication and collaboration among team members, as well as the significance of leveraging appropriate tools and techniques to generate meaningful insights from data. Additionally, I gained valuable experience in developing data analysis pipelines, which can be utilized in future projects to derive insights from large datasets.\n",
